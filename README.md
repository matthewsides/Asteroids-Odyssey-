### [1] Introduction

This document specifies a design for the conceptual features and mechanics (gameplay) of a game with the provisional title “Asteroids Odyssey”. It is based on the 1979 arcade game "Asteroids". Asteroids Odyssey a redition of "Asteroids" will hone the elements used in Asteroids and its style, merging the ideology and methodology of Astroids with newer ideologys, methodologies and technology, being re-built from the ground up and not ported (ported Asteroids version edited), Asteroids Odyssey will be compatible and be able to function on newer systems.

### [2] Scope

This documentation is intended to be read by programmers, artists and producers involved in the design implementation and testing of the the Desktop-game and Asteroids recreation  "Asteroids Odyssey".

### [3] Type Conventions

#### Player States

Move-


#### Interactable Entitys 

Big Space Ship

Small Space Ship

Small Asteroid


#### Player Camera View
The Camera will be a fixed aerial view, tracking the 2D ship graphic model continously (realtime), positioned in the middle of the screen. The system applied, similiar to the online game Diep.io which boasts a fixed camera that disables scrolling out to view the surrounding enviroment (area), thereafter adding another element to the game as players are forced to be more cautious.
